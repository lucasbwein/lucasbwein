# Hey, I'm Lucas 👋

**Graphics Programmer | Real-Time Rendering | GPU Optimization**

I build high-performance rendering systems and gameplay mechanics.

## Focus Areas

🔥 **GPU Ray Tracer (Metal, C++)**  
Real-time ray tracer built from scratch using Metal compute shaders.  
Optimized from 3 FPS → 60 FPS via parallelized ray-scene intersection, improved memory access patterns, and pipeline restructuring.

🌿 **Shell Texturing Fur & Grass Renderer (OpenGL, GLSL)**  
Layered shell rendering system achieving 100+ FPS with custom shading models and procedural strand variation.

🎮 **Monster TCG Battle Game (Godot)**  
Card battler with 30+ mechanics, AI systems, mana economy, and custom rendering pipeline. Near release.

## Tech

`C++` `GLSL` `HLSL` `Metal` `OpenGL` `Godot` `GDScript` `Python` `React`

## Contract Work

Available for:
- Shader development
- GPU performance optimization
- Rendering system architecture
- Godot gameplay systems
