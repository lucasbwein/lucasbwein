What I Work On
🔥 GPU Ray Tracer — Built from scratch with Metal compute shaders. Optimized from 3 FPS → 60 FPS through parallelized ray-scene intersection, restructured memory access patterns, and full rendering pipeline overhaul.
🌿 Shell Texturing Fur/Grass Renderer — Real-time fur and grass rendering at 100+ FPS using layered shell techniques and custom shading models.
🎮 Monster TCG Battle Game — Full card battler in Godot with 30+ mechanics, mana systems, enemy AI, abilities, and custom card rendering. Currently in polish phase.
🌑 Shadow Mapping System — PCF soft shadows, multi-light support, and real-time shadow cascades.
