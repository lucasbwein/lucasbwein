# Hey, I'm Lucas 👋

**Graphics Programmer & Game Developer** | Shader Development & GPU Optimization

## Available for Contract Work

I build real-time rendering systems and games. Currently finishing a TCG battle game in Godot and shipping graphics demos.

## What I Work On

🔥 **GPU Ray Tracer** — Built from scratch with Metal compute shaders. Optimized from 3 FPS → 60 FPS through parallelized ray-scene intersection, restructured memory access patterns, and full rendering pipeline overhaul.

🌿 **Shell Texturing Fur/Grass Renderer** — Real-time fur and grass rendering at 100+ FPS using layered shell techniques and custom shading models.

🎮 **Monster TCG Battle Game** — Full card battler in Godot with 30+ mechanics, mana systems, enemy AI, abilities, and custom card rendering. Shipping soon.
